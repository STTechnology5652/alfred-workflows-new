List the contents of directories, ordered by add or modified date. `rda` sorts from the most recently added and `rdz` does the reverse; `rdn` sorts from the most recently modified and `rdo` does the reverse.

The list is auto-refreshed, making for a good way to track changes.

To act on the selections, use the standard Alfred shortcuts. You can activate file actions, dive into directories, preview files, reveal in Finder, add to the file bufferâ€¦

By default the Workflow searches in `~/Desktop` and `~/Downloads`. Change the value in the `directories` Workflow Environment Variable to use different paths, separated by commas.
