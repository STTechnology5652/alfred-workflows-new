Output info from videos from [a plethora of video sources](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html), even when embedded in other pages.

The Universal Action and Hotkey can act on a selected link.

The `default_verbosity` Workflow Environment Variable applies to everything but the List Filter. It must be `succint`, `medium`, or `verbose`.
